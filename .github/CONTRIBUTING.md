# Contributing to Symphony

This is a TL;DR version of the [complete contribution guide](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/wiki/Contributing-to-Symphony).

The two most important things are [comments](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/wiki/Contributing-to-Symphony#commenting) and [https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/wiki/Contributing-to-Symphony#code-style](code style).

Please insure that any new method is properly documented and that the code style is respected.

Thanks!
